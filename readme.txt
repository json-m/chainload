i use this to grab info about exes that are called and exit quickly, where something like process explorer isn't helpful.

to compile i use mingw64, use whatever you want.

1. .\make.bat
2. rename {name}.exe to {name}.target.exe
2. put chainload.exe in place of {name}.exe
3. log appears in folder next to chainloader

if the calling application keeps replacing your exe, try setting it to read only
